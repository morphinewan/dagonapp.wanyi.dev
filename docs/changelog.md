# CHANGELOG

1. v1.7.2: 
    - Add option to turn off spotlight indexing. If you have a large amount of bookmarks, you can turn off this feature to enhance Dagon's performance.
    - Add option to turn off network offline detection. In some special cases (such as using VPN), network status detection will not work properly and Dagon can't sync data with pinboard service. Turn it off to make syncing works again.
    
    Attention: Image saving feature will be remove in the next 2.0 update. Sorry for that.
