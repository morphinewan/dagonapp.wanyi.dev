# What's New

1. v1.7.2: 
    - Add option to turn off spotlight indexing. If you have a large amount of bookmarks, you can turn off this feature to enhance Dagon's performance.
    - Add option to turn off network offline detection. In some special cases (such as using VPN), network status detection will not work properly and Dagon can't sync data with pinboard service. Turn it off to make syncing works again.
1. v1.7: Export bookmarks in .html file, then you can import them in common desktop browsers like Safari or Chrome.
1. v1.6: Now you can delete or rename the tags, and sync the tags with Pinboard manually.
1. v1.5: You can open all the bookmarks with Safari by default. You can turn it on in settings. And We are sorry to mention that support for Instagram  will be removed in this release. As some pages will not be crawled correctly wihout logging in.
1. v1.4: Batch tagging. [Check it out.](/guide06.md)
