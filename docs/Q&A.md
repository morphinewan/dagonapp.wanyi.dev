# Q & A

## 1. Why I can't see the "Add to Dagon" button in Safari or other app's Action activity view ?

It seems to be a bug in iOS 13. Please upgrade your iOS to latest version. After reboot automaticlly, Dagon's action extension will just work and appear. 

## 2. Why pinboard bookmarks not appear in Dagon list after I signed in and syned ?

It could be iCloud syncing is too slow and not completed. Please wait for a while. Or you can turn off iCloud Syncing and it may works.
